            <div class="resume-content mr-auto">
              <p>My name is Owen, I recently graduated university with a first in Computer Game Technology. A question I get asked commonly during interviews is "why did you decide to study computer games technology instead of a more generic computer science course?" My answer to this question is rather simple, I have always enjoyed playing computer games and took early steps during my school days into creating games and have since been thoroughly interested in the subject area. Also as I was about to dedicate the next few years into university study, I felt it a wise decision to take a course I believed I would enjoy doing whilst also being related to areas I would like to participate in during my career future. I enjoy computer games and I wanted to study computer technology, mashing the two together gave me the perfect university course.</p>

              <p>As for my future, I am enthusiastic to secure a position in the world of computer software, be it specifically games or otherwise, as I am confident my degree has provided me the skill necessary to excel in that area. Being who I am as a person means I am also eager to acquire a role that will allow me to develop further as an individual, both in regards to personal and technical skills as well as develop deeper knowledge about the computer technology industry.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Education</h2>

          <p>I studied Computer Games Technology at Manchester Metropolitan University and graduated in June 2017 with a First Class Honours. My tutors said it was a well deserved result as they knew how much effort I put into my work to get the grade I did. During the first year of my study, over the four units covered, I achieved and average result of 84%. In the second year my results averaged 79% and in the final year of study my results were 76% on average.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
          <p>In my free time, I enjoy many other aspects of life. I spent a large portion of my childhood actively participating in studying kickboxing, starting in 2006, sadly I gave this up due to moving away from home for my university studies. Before stopping I had achieved a purple belt in the school in which I was studying, as many school differ in belt colour order, this is only four belts away from Black Belt. During practice I entered several tournaments, receiving trophies in all other than my first adult competition. From the seven years experience, I had to learn to develop self control, discipline and respect, skills which I have maintained to this day. This is something I very much wish to recommit to, once I find myself in a position to able to do so.</p>
          <p>Gaming has been a major part of my life for as long as I remember. My first gaming system was a PlayStation One, a console which I still own today (though sadly the aerial cable no longer works), and I spent many hours playing during my free time as a child. However, it would have been during my teenage years when games really took off for me with the experience of playing online with school friends on Xbox Live on the Xbox 360. Since then I have played many games, most notably World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Runescape, Dark Souls series, Halo 3, Call of Duty series, Rock Bands and Guitar Heroes, as well as many more. For me, games are challenges that require time, dedication, research and often a great deal of teamwork to beat and overcome. Games have taught me to push my mental capabilities to the edge and once there, nothing cannot be achieved.</p>
